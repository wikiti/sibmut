# SIBMUT app #

## 1. Description ##
SIBMUT stands for "Should I bring my umbrella today". It's just a simple app which will ask you for a location and an amount of hours.It will ask [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/), and if it rains in that period of time, the app will tell you to take your umbrella. Easy, right?

Test the live demo in [Heroku](http://sibmut.herokuapp.com/ "sibmut-app").

## 2. Usage ##
Just open *index.html* in a web-browser, or in a server.

Also, you may want to run it as a rack application, like so:
````sh
bundle install
rackup
````
